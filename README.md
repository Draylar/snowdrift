# Snowdrift

Plains of snow, slowly increasing in size as flurries dance to the ground. Snowdrift is a simple mod that makes snowpiles appear while it snows; these piles disappear once the snow stops.

Snowdrift is built for the Fabric loader, and is licensed under MIT. You are free to use the code in this repository as needed.

## Installation

1. Download the latest Snowdrift jar from the release tab or the CurseForge page
    * GitHub releases may be behind the CurseForge page
2. Drag and drop into your Minecraft jar alongside an appropriate version of Fabric API
3. Tweak the config file as needed after running the game once
4. Enter a world and find an area that is snowing
